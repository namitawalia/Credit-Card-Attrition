# Credit Card Attrition Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting credit card attrition. Credit card attrition refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue the use of their credit cards, resulting in lost revenue for credit card issuers. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, credit card companies can take proactive measures to retain them, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing revenue loss.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical information about credit card customers, including demographic data, transaction history, credit limits, and whether or not the customer churned. The dataset is sourced from [provide source].

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a credit card customer is likely to churn or not. This prediction can help credit card companies identify at-risk customers and take appropriate actions to prevent churn.

## Methodology
The project follows these general steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are performed to optimize model performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score.
5. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model for inference, making it available for integration into production systems.

## Repository Structure
